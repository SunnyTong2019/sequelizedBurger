# Eat-Da-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger is a burger logger application that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button and an input field to log the name of which customer ate the burger. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
